Welcome to Phasmo-notes, a project dedicated to enhancing the research experience in the game Phasmophobia. Our goal is to go beyond the standard evidence provided in the in-game journal. In addition to the basic evidence, Phasmo-notes enables you to include additional annotations such as ghost noises, step speeds, and behaviors in response to specific tools like incense or salt.

## Overview

Phasmo-notes aims to provide a comprehensive platform for players to conduct in-depth investigations. Move beyond the limitations of the default investigation journal and contribute valuable insights that extend the scope of the game's built-in features.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Annotations:** Record detailed observations about ghost behavior, noises, and reactions to various tools.
  
- **Enhanced Investigation:** Go beyond the standard evidence and create a more thorough research log.
